            <h2>Menstural Phase</h2>
            <p>During your period, your body is eliminating excess blood and tissue, so it's
                important to stay well-hydrated and eat foods that are rich in iron, such as leafy greens,
                red meat, and legumes. Other foods that may help support hormone balance during this phase
                include omega-3 fatty acids (found in fatty fish, walnuts, and chia seeds) and magnesium 
                (found in leafy greens, almonds, and dark chocolate).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="follicular-phase">
            <h2>Follicular Phase</h2>
            <p>In the follicular phase, your body is preparing for ovulation, so it's important to eat foods
                that support healthy egg development, such as protein-rich foods like eggs, lean meat, and beans.
                Other foods that may help support hormone balance during this phase include complex carbohydrates 
                (found in whole grains, sweet potatoes, and fruit) and foods rich in vitamin E (found in almonds, avocados, and sunflower seeds).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="ovulatory-phase">
            <h2>Ovulatory Phase</h2>
            <p>During ovulation, your body needs plenty of nutrients to support healthy egg release, so it's
                important to eat foods that are rich in protein, healthy fats, and antioxidants. Some good 
                options include leafy greens, eggs, nuts and seeds, and fatty fish like salmon.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="luteal-phase">
            <h2>Luteal Phase</h2>
            <p>In the luteal phase, your body is preparing for menstruation, so it's important to eat foods
                that support healthy progesterone production, such as foods rich in vitamin B6 (found in bananas,
                chickpeas, and chicken), magnesium (found in leafy greens, nuts, and seeds), and zinc (found in 
                oysters, beef, and pumpkin seeds). Some women also find it helpful to eat foods that support healthy
                digestion, such as fermented foods like kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi.
